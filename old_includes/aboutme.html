            <p><a href="http://joseki-tech.com/" >Integritas Analytics</a> is a data science consulting company based out of Lake Forest, Illinois.

            <h3>Independent Work</h3>
            <p>In my off time from the two jobs, I worked on my own independent projects. One example is my undergraduate thesis, though I'll be starting senior year with plenty of work ahead. The application will be leverageing computer vision and machine learning to reconstruct a solve of the Rubick's Cube,  <a href="https://youtu.be/NevGDFBfQGw?t=8s">which can be blisteringly fast</a>.</p>

            <p>Under <a href"http://www.corey.toler-franklin.com/">Professor Corey Toler-Franklin</a>, I conducted computer graphics research as a staff member in the CISE department. My work was to be used as a step in the pipeline for an augmented-reality application, published at SIGGRAPH. I grew as a professional computer scientist and researcher, and couldn't be more thankful to Dr. Toler-Franklin for the experience.</p>
